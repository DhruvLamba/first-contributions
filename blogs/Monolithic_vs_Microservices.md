# Monolithic vs. Microservice Architecture
##### by [@kudoabhijeet](http://github.com/kudoabhijeet)

## Monolithic Architecture
The monolithic architecture is considered to be a traditional way of building applications. A monolithic application is built as a single and indivisible unit. Usually, such a solution comprises a client-side user interface, a server side-application, and a database. It is unified and all the functions are managed and served in one place.

**Use cases:**

1. Small teams.
2. Simple apps (no scalability reqd.).

## Microservice Architecture
While a monolithic application is a single unified unit, a microservices architecture breaks it down into a collection of smaller independent units. These units carry out every application process as a separate service. So all the services have their own logic and the database as well as perform the specific functions.

**Use cases:**

1. Complex apps.
2. Distributed services.
